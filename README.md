:metal: Using tests(Mocha + Chai) in the Hell Triangle Challenge

Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom

Example:
```
   6
  3 5
 9 7 1
4 6 8 4
```
An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row
So the element 3 in row 2 can be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1

In this triangle the maximum total is 6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26

To install the dependencies:
```cmd
npm i
```

To see the application running:
```cmd
npm run-script serve
```

To test the application:
```cmd
npm test
```
