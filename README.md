# Hell-triangle
Using tests(Mocha + Chai) in the Hell Triangle Challenge


To install the dependencies:
```cmd
npm i
```

To see the application running:
```cmd
npm run-script serve
```

To test the application:
```cmd
npm test
```

I chose javascript to make the challenge because it is a universal technology, which is used in any project that involves web, regardless of the main technology.
